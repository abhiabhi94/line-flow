A relaxing puzzle game where you draw a continuous line through all the edges of a shape — without lifting your finger or retracing your path.

## About

LineFlow presents you with geometric puzzles based on Eulerian paths. Your goal is simple: connect all the dots by drawing a single, unbroken line that visits every edge exactly once.

It's the kind of puzzle you might doodle on a napkin — now on your phone.
